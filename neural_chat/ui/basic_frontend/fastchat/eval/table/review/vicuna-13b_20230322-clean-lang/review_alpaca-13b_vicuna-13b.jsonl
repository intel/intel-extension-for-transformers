The explanation was clear, but it would have been more helpful to include a code example.\n\nAssistant 2 provided a code implementation of a queue using two stacks in Python. The code is mostly accurate, but there are a few issues. The dequeue method is incorrect, as it should transfer elements from the in_stack to the out_stack if the out_stack is empty, and then pop the top element from the out_stack. The peek method should also return the top element of the out_stack if it's not empty. The enqueue method does not need to clear the out_stack.

Combine the terms on the left-hand side by subtracting 5x from both sides: 3x = -5x\n3. Simplify the left-hand side by dividing both sides by 3: x = -5/3\n4. Take the natural logarithm of both sides to get the solution in terms of the natural logarithm base e: ln|x| = ln|-5/3| = -5/3 ln|e| = -5/3 ln(1.414) = -5/3 ln(1.414) = -5/3 ln(1 + 1/1.414) = -5/3 ln(1.414)\n5. Exponentiate both sides to get the solution in terms of e: x = e^(-5/3)\n6. Rearrange the solution to get x in terms of Euler's number: x = e^(-5/3) = 1/1.414^(-5/3) = 0.5877\n7.

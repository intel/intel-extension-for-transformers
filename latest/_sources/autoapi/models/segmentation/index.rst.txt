Module Contents

.. py:class:: MaskHeadSmallConv(dim, fpn_dims, context_dim)



   Simple convolutional head, using group norm.

   Upsampling is done using a FPN approach


.. py:class:: MHAttentionMap(query_dim, hidden_dim, num_heads, dropout=0.0, bias=True)



   This is a 2D attention module, which only returns the attention softmax (no multiplication by value)


.. py:function:: dice_loss(inputs, targets, num_boxes)

   Compute the DICE loss, similar to generalized IOU for masks
   :param inputs: A float tensor of arbitrary shape.
                  The predictions for each example.
   :param targets:
                   A float tensor with the same shape as inputs. Stores the binary
                    classification label for each element in inputs
                   (0 for the negative class and 1 for the positive class).


.. py:function:: sigmoid_focal_loss(inputs, targets, num_boxes, alpha: float = 0.25, gamma: float = 2)

   Loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.
   :param inputs: A float tensor of arbitrary shape.
                  The predictions for each example.
   :param targets:
                   A float tensor with the same shape as inputs. Stores the binary
                    classification label for each element in inputs
                   (0 for the negative class and 1 for the positive class).
   :param alpha: (optional) Weighting factor in range (0,1) to balance
                 positive vs negative examples. Default = -1 (no weighting).
   :param gamma: Exponent of the modulating factor (1 - p_t) to
                 balance easy vs hard examples.

   :returns: Loss tensor


.. py:class:: PostProcessPanoptic(is_thing_map, threshold=0.85)



   This class converts the output of the model to the final panoptic result, in the format expected by the
   coco panoptic API.


   .. py:method:: forward(outputs, processed_sizes, target_sizes=None)

      This function computes the panoptic prediction from the model's predictions.

      :param outputs: This is a dict coming directly from the model. See the model doc for the content.
      :param processed_sizes: This is a list of tuples (or torch tensors) of sizes of the images that were passed to the
                              model, ie the size after data augmentation but before batching.
      :param target_sizes: This is a list of tuples (or torch tensors) corresponding to the requested final size
                           of each prediction. If left to None, it will default to the processed_sizes

.. py:class:: HungarianMatcher(cost_class: float = 1, cost_bbox: float = 1, cost_giou: float = 1)



   This class computes an assignment between the targets and the predictions of the network.

   For efficiency reasons, the targets don't include the no_object. Because of this, in general,
   there are more predictions than targets. In this case, we do a 1-to-1 matching of the best predictions,
   while the others are un-matched (and thus treated as non-objects).


   .. py:method:: forward(outputs, targets)

      Performs the matching.

      Params:
          outputs: This is a dict that contains at least these entries:
               "pred_logits": Tensor of dim [batch_size, num_queries, num_classes] with the classification logits
               "pred_boxes": Tensor of dim [batch_size, num_queries, 4] with the predicted box coordinates

          targets: This is a list of targets (len(targets) = batch_size), where each target is a dict containing:
               "labels": Tensor of dim [num_target_boxes] (where num_target_boxes is the number of ground-truth
                         objects in the target) containing the class labels
               "boxes": Tensor of dim [num_target_boxes, 4] containing the target box coordinates

      :returns:     - index_i is the indices of the selected predictions (in order)
                    - index_j is the indices of the corresponding selected targets (in order)
                For each batch element, it holds:
                    len(index_i) = len(index_j) = min(num_queries, num_target_boxes)
      :rtype: A list of size batch_size, containing tuples of (index_i, index_j) where

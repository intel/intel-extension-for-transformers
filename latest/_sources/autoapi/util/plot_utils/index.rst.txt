   :: Inputs - logs = list containing Path objects, each pointing to individual dir with a log file
             - fields = which results to plot from each log file - plots both training and test for each field.
             - ewm_col = optional, which column to use as the exponential weighted smoothing of the plots
             - log_name = optional, name of log file if different than default 'log.txt'.

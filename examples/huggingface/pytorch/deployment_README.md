# Deployment
Intel Extension for Transformers provides multiple reference deployments: 1) [**Neural Engine**](neural_engine); 2) [IPEX](ipex/).

## Neural Engine
Neural Engine can provide the optimal performance of extremely compressed transformer based models, the optimization is both from HW and SW. It's a reference deployment for Intel Extension for Transformers, we will enable other backends.

#### Installation
Windows and Linux are supported.

##### 0. Prepare environment and requirement
```
# prepare your env
conda create -n <env name> python=3.7 absl-py -y
```

##### 1. Build neural engine

``` bash
cd <intel_extension_for_transformers_folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install [-v|--verbose] [-e] .  # add -e for editable installation (i.e. setuptools “develop mode”)
```

If you only use backends, just set environment variable `BACKENDS_ONLY=1` while installing. The new package is named intel_extension_for_transformers_backends. And the Intel Neural Compressor isn't necessary.

```shell
env BACKENDS_ONLY=1 pip install [-v|--verbose] [-e] .
```
>**Note**: Please check either intel_extension_for_transformers or intel_extension_for_transformers_backends installed in env to prevent possible conflicts. You can pip uninstall intel_extension_for_transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers_backends before installing.

##### 2. Generate optimal BERT model

```python
from intel_extension_for_transformers.llm.runtime.deprecated.compile import compile
model = compile('/path/to/your/model')
model.save('/ir/path')
```
Note that Neural Engine supports TensorFlow and ONNX models.

##### 3. Deployment

###### 3.1. C++ API

`neural_engine --config=<path to yaml file> --weight=<path to bin file> --batch_size=32 --iterations=20`

You can use the `numactl` command to bind cpu cores and open multi-instances:

`OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 numactl -C '0-3' neural_engine ...`

Open/Close Log:(GLOG_minloglevel=1/GLOG_minloglevel=2)

`export GLOG_minloglevel=2 neural_engine ...`


###### 3.2. Python API

If you use `pip install .` to install the neural engine, then you can use python api as following.

```python
from intel_extension_for_transformers.llm.runtime.deprecated.compile import compile
# load the model
graph = compile('./model_and_tokenizer/int8-model.onnx')
# use graph.inference to do inference
out = graph.inference([input_ids, segment_ids, input_mask])
# dump the neural engine IR to file
graph.save('./ir')
```

The `input_ids`, `segment_ids` and `input_mask` are the input numpy array data of model, and the input dimension is variable. 
Note that the `out` is a dict contains the bert model output tensor name and numpy data (`out={output name : numpy data}`). 

##### 4. Analyze operator performance

If you want to analyze performance of each operator, just `export ENGINE_PROFILING=1` and `export INST_NUM=<inst_num>`.
It will dump latency of each operator to `./engine_profiling/profiling_<time>_<inst_count>.csv` and each iteration to `./engine_profiling/profiling_<time>_<inst_count>.json`.

## IPEX
Intel® Extension for PyTorch* extends PyTorch with optimizations for extra performance boost on Intel hardware.

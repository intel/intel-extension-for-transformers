        "response": "The deep breathing program can be described as an emotion-focused coping strategy. The program teaches patients to manage their emotions and cope with stress by using deep breathing exercises, which can induce the relaxation response and reduce symptoms of stress. The program also involves learning about stress and taking control of the situation, which are characteristics of problem-focused coping. Avoidance-focused coping is not necessarily involved in the program, as patients are not instructed to distance themselves from their physiological reactions to stressful experiences."

        "response": "The tuberoinfundibular tract is a tuberous structure located in the lower part of the median eminence, which connects the tuberous part of the pituitary gland to the infundibulum. It is a tuberous structure that carries releasing hormones from the adenohypophysis to the pituitary stalk, where they are released into the bloodstream. The tuberoinfundibular tract is an important regulator of the release of hormones such as oxytocin and ADH (antidiuretic hormone) from the adenohypophysis."

        "response": "(C) A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene.\n\nHuntington disease is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal Huntingtin protein. The linked image shows a Southern blot that was obtained with genomic DNA that was probed with a DNA complementary to the gene for the Huntingtin protein. The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA, which is consistent with the genetic cause of HD being an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene."

        "response": "The answer is (C) Right and left middle cerebral arteries. \n\nThe left middle cerebral artery typically supplies blood to the left hemisphere of the brain, including the Broca's area, which is involved in speech production. The right middle cerebral artery typically supplies blood to the right hemisphere of the brain, including the Wernicke's area, which is involved in speech comprehension. However, it is possible for blood flow to be shared between the two hemispheres, leading to speech involvement on both sides of the brain."

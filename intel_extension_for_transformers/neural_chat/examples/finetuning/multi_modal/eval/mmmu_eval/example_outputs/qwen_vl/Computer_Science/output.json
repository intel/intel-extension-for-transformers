We can try to add a flow of 1 to the path, but since there is no path from v1 to v6, this will not increase the max flow. We can then try to add a flow of 1 to the path from v2 to v3, which will increase the max flow from v1 to v6 to 2.

It would also be reasonable to try decreasing $\\sigma^2$. \n\nWhen the C value is too large, the SVM may not be able to find a good decision boundary that separates the classes well. On the other hand, when $\\sigma^2$ is too small, the SVM may not be able to capture the underlying structure of the data well, leading to underfitting. Therefore, decreasing C and $\\sigma^2$ can help improve the performance of the SVM classifier by making it more flexible and able to capture the underlying structure of the data."

        "response": "The correct answer is (A) First, w2 becomes zero, and then w1 becomes zero.\n\nWhen using logistic regression with L1 regularization, the regularization term adds a penalty to the absolute value of the coefficients. As the value of C increases, the regularization term becomes more severe, causing the coefficients to shrink towards zero. The coefficient of the non-zero feature will not become zero until the coefficient of the other feature becomes zero. Therefore, the first feature to become zero is the one with the smallest coefficient, which is w2 in this case. Once w2 becomes zero, w1 becomes the only non-zero coefficient and continues to shrink towards zero as well."

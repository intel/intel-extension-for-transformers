This disease can cause stunted growth, yellowing, and eventual death of the affected branches. It is not evenly distributed across the crown of the tree, and the detached branches are a clear indication of the disease's progression. Therefore, the answer is (D)."

While mistletoe can be a cause of concern for some people, it generally does not harm the host tree unless the infestation is severe. In fact, mistletoe can actually benefit the tree by removing excess nutrients from the plant, which can be harmful to the tree's health. However, it is important to monitor the growth of mistletoe and take appropriate measures to control its population if it becomes too dense."

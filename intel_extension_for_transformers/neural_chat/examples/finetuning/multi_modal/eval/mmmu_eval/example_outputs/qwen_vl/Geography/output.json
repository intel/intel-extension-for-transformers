The liquid limit is the point at which the soil becomes plastic. For a liquid limit of 76g, the cone settlement of 6mm indicates that the soil is in the hard plastic phase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A)."

        "response": "We know that the wave velocity is the distance between two points divided by the time it takes for the wave to travel between the two points. So, if we know the wave velocity and the time it takes for the wave to travel a certain distance, we can use the formula to calculate the distance between the two points.\nThe wave velocity is given as 3555.6m/s. The time it takes for the wave to travel from t1 to t2 is 0.5s, and the time it takes for the wave to travel from t2 to t3 is 1.0s. So, the distance between t1 and t2 is given by the formula:\ndistance = wave velocity * time\ndistance = 3555.6m/s * 0.5s\ndistance = 1777.8m\nThe distance between t2 and t3 is given by the formula:\ndistance = wave velocity * time\ndistance = 3555.6m/s * 1.0s\ndistance = 3555.6m\nSo, the total distance between t1 and t3 is the sum of these two distances:\ntotal distance = distance from t1 to t2 + distance from t2 to t3\ntotal distance = 1777.8m + 3555.6m\ntotal distance = 5333.4m\nTherefore, the closest value to the length of the pile is 5333.4m, which is the answer to the question (C)."

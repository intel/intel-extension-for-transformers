In this case, the equation is:\n\nN2(g) + 3H2(g) \u2192 2NH3(g)\n\nWe are given that 3.0 mol of O2 is present, so we can use the balanced equation to determine the number of moles of each reactant and product. We can see that 1 mol of O2 is required to produce 2 moles of NH3, so we have 3.0 mol O2 \u00d7 2 = 6.0 mol of NH3. Similarly, we can see that 6.0 mol of H2 is required to produce 2 moles of NH3, so we have 6.0 mol H2 \u00d7 2 = 12.0 mol of H2. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."

        "response": "The manufacture of compound F requires five separate chemical reactions, and the percent yield for each step is given in the diagram. The percent yield for the first step is 20.0%, the second step is 30.0%, the third step is 40.0%, the fourth step is 50.0%, and the fifth step is 20.0%. Therefore, the missing percent yield for the fifth step is 20.0%. The missing quantity for the first step is 0.50 mol, and the missing quantity for the second step is 0.05 mol. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20.0%,0.50 mol,0.05 mol,20.0%."

Once upon a time, a little girl lived in a quaint village nestled among rolling hills. She had a heart filled with curiosity and dreams of adventure. One day, she decided to leave her cozy home behind and set out on a journey to explore the world beyond her familiar surroundings.

As she ventured forth, she encountered many wondrous sights and met fascinating people along the way. The little girl learned about different cultures, customs, and traditions that broadened her perspective and enriched her life. Her experiences taught her valuable lessons about kindness, courage, and resilience.

Throughout her travels, she made lifelong friends who shared her passion for discovery. Together, they faced challenges and celebrated triumphs, forming unbreakable bonds that would last a lifetime.

Eventually, the little girl returned to her village, now a wise and compassionate young woman. She brought back knowledge and memories that inspired others to dream big and follow their hearts. As she grew older, she continued to share her stories and wisdom with those around her, inspiring future generations to embrace the beauty of the unknown and never stop seeking new horizons.

# 3. Run chatbot in server mode with UI

## 3.1 Start the service

set the oneAPI environment variables for GPU `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` (skip this for CPU)

```
cd ~/itrex/intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/examples/quick_start/chatbot
python chatbot_server.py
```

Here is the completely output:

### 3.1.1 Verify the client connection to server is OK.

Open a new linux console, run following command

`curl -vv -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions`

Check the output. Make sure there is no network connection and proxy setting issue at Client side

### 3.1.2 Test request command at client side

Sent a request to chatbat-server from client 


```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "model": "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1",
    "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Intel Xeon Scalable Processors."}
    ]
    }'
```

At the server side, there is message:
```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:52532 - "POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

At the client side, the response are similar message as following.
The message contains the LLM answer and other information about the request.
```

## 3.2 Set up Server mode UI

Create UI conda envitonment
```
conda create -n chatbot-ui python=3.9
conda activate chatbot-ui

cd ~/itrex/intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/ui/gradio/basic
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install gradio==3.36.0
pip install pydantic==1.10.13
```

## 3.3 Start the web service

Set the default service port
Edit app.py line 745, set the server port. For example we set port as 8008.

```
    demo.queue(
        concurrency_count=concurrency_count, status_update_rate=10, api_open=False
    ).launch(
        server_name=host, server_port=8008, share=share, max_threads=200
    )
```

Start the service:
cd ~/itrex/intel_extension_for_transformers/neural_chat/ui/gradio/basic
`python app.py`

The output is as following:
```

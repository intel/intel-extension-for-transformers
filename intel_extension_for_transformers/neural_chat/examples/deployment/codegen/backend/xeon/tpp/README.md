This README serves as a guide to set up the backend for a code generation chatbot utilizing the NeuralChat framework. You can deploy this code generation chatbot across various platforms, including Intel XEON Scalable Processors, Habana's Gaudi processors (HPU), Intel Data Center GPU and Client GPU, Nvidia Data Center GPU, and Client GPU.

This code generation chatbot demonstrates how to deploy it specifically on Intel XEON processors using Intel(R) Tensor Processing Primitives extension for PyTorch. To run the 34b or 70b level LLM model, we require implementing model parallelism using multi-node strategy.


# Setup Conda

First, you need to install and configure the Conda environment:

```bash
# Download and install Miniconda
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda*.sh
source ~/.bashrc
conda create -n demo python=3.9
conda activate demo
```

# Install numactl

Next, install the numactl library:

```shell
sudo apt install numactl
```

# Install ITREX

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers.git
cd ./intel-extension-for-transformers/
python setup.py install
```

# Install NeuralChat Python Dependencies

Install neuralchat dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r ../../../../../../requirements_cpu.txt
pip install -r  ../../../../../../pipeline/plugins/retrieval/requirements.txt
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio intel-extension-for-pytorch -y
python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
python -m pip install intel-extension-for-pytorch
python -m pip install oneccl_bind_pt --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/cpu/us/
pip install transformers==4.31.0 # need to downgrade transformers to 4.31.0 for LLAMA
```

Install Intel MPI:
```bash
wget https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/IRC_NAS/749f02a5-acb8-4bbb-91db-501ff80d3f56/l_mpi_oneapi_p_2021.12.0.538.sh
bash l_mpi_oneapi_p_2021.12.0.538.sh
torch_ccl_path=$(python -c "import torch; import oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch; import os;  print(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch.__file__)))" 2> /dev/null)
source $torch_ccl_path/env/setvars.sh
```

Install Intel(R) Tensor Processing Primitives extension for PyTorch from source code.

```bash
# Install from source code
git clone https://github.com/libxsmm/tpp-pytorch-extension.git
cd tpp-pytorch-extension/
git checkout feature_mxfp4_poc
git submodule update --init
python setup.py install
```

Currently there are some issues when using BF16, so we need to enable MXFP4 by the below commands:
```bash
export TPP_CACHE_REMAPPED_WEIGHTS=0
export USE_MXFP4=1
export KV_CACHE_INC_SIZE=512
```

# Configure the codegen.yaml

You can customize the configuration file 'codegen.yaml' to match your environment setup. Here's a table to help you understand the configurable options:

|  Item               | Value                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| host                | 0.0.0.0                                    |
| port                | 8000                                       |
| model_name_or_path  | "Phind/Phind-CodeLlama-34B-v2"             |
| device              | "cpu"                                      |
| use_tpp             | true                                       |
| tasks_list          | ['codegen']                                |

Note: To switch from code generation to text generation mode, adjust the model_name_or_path settings accordingly, e.g. the model_name_or_path can be set "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf".

# Using Single NumaNode
To configure a single NUMA node on Xeon processors, edit the hostfile located at `../../../../../../server/config/hostfile` and set the NUMA node number to 1.

## Modify hostfile
```bash
vim ../../../../../../server/config/hostfile
    localhost slots=1
```

## Run the Code Generation Chatbot Server

To start the code-generating chatbot server, use the following command:

```shell
bash run.sh
```


# Configure Multi-NumaNodes
To utilize multi-socket model parallelism on Xeon servers, you'll need to adjust the hostfile settings.
For instance, to allocate 3 NUMA nodes on a single socket of the GNR server, modify the hostfile as shown below:

## Modify hostfile
```bash
vim ../../../../../../server/config/hostfile
    localhost slots=3
```

Afterward, run the run.sh script as previously instructed.


# Configure Multi-Nodes
To use the multi-node model parallelism with Xeon servers, you need to configure a hostfile first and make sure ssh is able between your servers.
For example, you have two servers which have the IP of `192.168.1.1` and `192.168.1.2`, and each of it has 3 numa nodes on single socket.

## Modify hostfile
```bash
vim ../../../../../../server/config/hostfile
    192.168.1.1 slots=3
    192.168.1.2 slots=3
```

## Configure SSH between Servers
In order to enable this hostfile, you have to make sure `192.168.1.1` and `192.168.1.2` are able to access each other via SSH. Check it with `ssh 192.168.1.2`.

If your servers are not available with SSH, follow the instructions below.

1. Generate SSH Key
    Execute this command on both servers to generate ssh key in  `~/.ssh/`.
    ```shell
    ssh-keygen
    ```
2. Copy SSH Key
    Execute this command on both servers. Specify your user on the server.
    ```shell
    ssh-copy-id user@192.168.1.2
    ```
3. Test SSH Connection
    Test whether SSH is available now.
    ```shell
    ssh user@192.168.1.2
    ```
4. Check Network
    Check network communication between servers.
    ```shell
    ping 192.168.1.2
    ```

If you cannot SSH to your local server via IP, configure it with localhost as below.
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Then modify hostfile as below.
```bash
localhost slots=3
192.168.1.2 slots=3
```

## Run the Code Generation Chatbot Server
Before running the code-generating chatbot server, make sure you have already deploy the same conda environment and intel-extension-for-tranformers codes on both servers.

To start the code-generating chatbot server, use the following command:

```shell
bash run.sh
```

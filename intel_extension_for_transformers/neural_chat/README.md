# Getting Started

## OpenAI-Compatible RESTful APIs

NeuralChat provides OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs for LLM inference, so you can use NeuralChat as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI APIs. NeuralChat service can also be accessible through [OpenAI client library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), `curl` commands, and `requests` library. See [neuralchat_api.md](./docs/neuralchat_api.md).

### Launch OpenAI-compatible Service

NeuralChat launches a chatbot service using [Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1](https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1) by default. You can customize the chatbot service by configuring the YAML file.


You can start the NeuralChat server either using the shell command or Python code.

Using Shell Command:

```shell
neuralchat_server start --config_file ./server/config/neuralchat.yaml
```

Using Python Code:

```python
from intel_extension_for_transformers.neural_chat import NeuralChatServerExecutor
server_executor = NeuralChatServerExecutor()
server_executor(config_file="./server/config/neuralchat.yaml", log_file="./neuralchat.log")
```

### Access the Service

Once the service is running, you can observe an OpenAI-compatible endpoint `/v1/chat/completions`. You can use any of below ways to access the endpoint.

#### Using OpenAI Client Library

First, install openai-python:

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

Then, interact with the model:

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "EMPTY"
openai.base_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/'
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
      model="Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1",
      messages=[
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Intel Xeon Scalable Processors."},
      ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
>**Note**: When intel-extension-for-transformers <= 1.3.1, please try [command](#using-curl) below


#### Using Curl
```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "model": "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1",
    "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Intel Xeon Scalable Processors."}
    ]
    }'
```

>**Note**: When intel-extension-for-transformers <= 1.3.1, please use old command like:
> ```shell
> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Tell me about Intel Xeon Scalable Processors."}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions
> ```


#### Using Python Requests Library

```python
import requests
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions'
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
data = '{"model": "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1", "messages": [ \
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, \
          {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Intel Xeon Scalable Processors."}] \
       }'
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
print(response.json())
```

>**Note**: When intel-extension-for-transformers <= 1.3.1, please try [command](#using-curl) above


## Langchain Extension APIs

Intel Extension for Transformers provides a comprehensive suite of Langchain-based extension APIs, including advanced retrievers, embedding models, and vector stores. These enhancements are carefully crafted to expand the capabilities of the original langchain API, ultimately boosting overall performance. This extension is specifically tailored to enhance the functionality and performance of RAG.

### Vector Stores

We introduce enhanced vector store operations, enabling users to adjust and fine-tune their settings even after the chatbot has been initialized, offering a more adaptable and user-friendly experience. For langchain users, integrating and utilizing optimized Vector Stores is straightforward by replacing the original Chroma API in langchain.

```python
from langchain_community.llms.huggingface_pipeline import HuggingFacePipeline
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_core.vectorstores import VectorStoreRetriever
from intel_extension_for_transformers.langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
retriever = VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=Chroma(...))
retrievalQA = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=HuggingFacePipeline(...), retriever=retriever)
```

### Retrievers

We provide optimized retrievers such as `VectorStoreRetriever`, `ChildParentRetriever` to efficiently handle vectorstore operations, ensuring optimal retrieval performance.

```python
from intel_extension_for_transformers.langchain.retrievers import ChildParentRetriever
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
retriever = ChildParentRetriever(vectorstore=Chroma(documents=child_documents), parentstore=Chroma(documents=parent_documents), search_type=xxx, search_kwargs={...})
docs=retriever.get_relevant_documents("Intel")
```

Please refer to this [documentation](./pipeline/plugins/retrieval/README.md) for more details.


## Customizing the NeuralChat Service

Users have the flexibility to customize the NeuralChat service by making modifications in the YAML configuration file. Detailed instructions can be found in the [documentation](./server/README.md).

### Supported Models

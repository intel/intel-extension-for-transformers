We aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards.
Our world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet.
We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments.
The past several years demonstrated just how much technology is increasingly central to every aspect of our lives, all of which depends on semiconductors.
With our focus on delivering leadership products, open and secure platforms and resilient manufacturing, Intel has the right strategy in place to enable this global digitalization and fuel customer success.
The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.
We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers.
Intel plans to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025, and we remain on track to deliver on our goal of five manufacturing technology nodes in four years.

Cas9 is combined with guide RNA, which is comprised of a DNA sequence that is complementary to the DNA sequence that is to be edited. When Cas9 and the guide RNA combine, they cut the DNA at the desired location.\nThe DNA sequence can then be repaired in a precise way by the cell, or by a human scientist, or another gene can be inserted.

The red planet is much farther from the Sun, and as such, it's a lot colder. Average temperatures on Mars are about -80 degrees Fahrenheit. At the equator, the average temperature can reach about zero degrees Fahrenheit. The surface of Mars is also very dry. Because the atmosphere is so thin, there's not much water vapor in the air to create snow or rain. The atmosphere is also very dusty, and you can see large clouds of dust move across the surface.\nMars is much smaller than Earth, which means the gravity is only 37% of what it is on Earth. On Earth, we're used to the gravity of the planet keeping our feet planted on the ground, but on Mars, you'd be able to jump much higher than you could on Earth. The atmosphere on Mars is very thin, only about 1% as dense as Earth's. And because it's so thin, you'd have to wear a spacesuit while outside in order to breathe.\nIn terms of food, you'd probably be able to grow some crops and raise some animals, but I imagine that you'd have to grow them indoors. Also, you'd have to grow all of your food. Mars doesn't have any large bodies of water, so you couldn't fish. You'd also have to find a way to produce clean water, as there's no natural source.\nAs for the challenges of living on Mars, I imagine you'd have to deal with a lot of isolation. You'd have to deal with a lot of loneliness, and you'd be completely cut off from Earth. You'd also have to deal with a lot of boredom. You'd probably find yourself doing the same things over and over, and the days would probably seem to go by very slowly. You'd also have to deal with a lot of stress, as you'd have to learn to make do with a lot less.

The characters in the virtual world are all artificial intelligence entities, and the user's experience in the real world is with two characters, his friend and his girlfriend. The user is a young man in the film, and the virtual character is a young woman. The two characters have a virtual relationship, and then the virtual character is killed by a bug in the system. This causes the user to fall into a deep depression, and he begins to question his own reality. He decides to go to the real world to get treatment for his depression. In the real world, the user has to decide whether he wants to stay in the real world or return to the virtual world.

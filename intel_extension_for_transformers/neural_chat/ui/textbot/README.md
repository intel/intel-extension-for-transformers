Hugging Face Space helps to make some amazing ML applications more accessible to the community. Inspired by this, we can create a chatbot application on Hugging Face Spaces.

The new space is like a new project that supports GitHub-style code repository management.

## ðŸš€ Check configuration
We recommend using Gradio as the Space SDK, keeping the default values for the other settings.

For detailed information about the configuration settings, please refer to the [Hugging Face Spaces Config Reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-config-reference).

## ðŸš€ Setup application
We recommend directly using this textbot frontend code, which shows the reference implementation that we already deployed on Hugging Face Space. 
To set up your application, copy the code files from this directory and configure them as needed.Alternatively, you can clone the existing space from [https://huggingface.co/spaces/Intel/NeuralChat-MPT](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Intel/NeuralChat-MPT).

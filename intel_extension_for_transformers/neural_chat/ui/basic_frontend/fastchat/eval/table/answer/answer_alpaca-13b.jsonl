Firstly, a large amount of electric charge must accumulate in the atmosphere, typically in a storm system. Then, the air must become increasingly unstable, leading to rising air and a strong updraft. This causes an electric breakdown of the air, and then an exchange of electricity occurs from the cloud to the ground, forming a lightning bolt. As these conditions are necessary for a lightning strike to occur, about 2000 lightning strikes happen on Earth each day.", "answer_id": "kf8nahQVci2ZLaYikagB7U", "model_id": "alpaca-13b:v1", "metadata": {"huggingface_argument": {"do_sample": true, "temperature": 0.7, "max_new_tokens": 1024}}}
